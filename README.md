Small script to mess around with Kriging in D. Inspired by this blog post: http://the-witness.net/news/2010/05/kriging-is-cool/.

Currently the code works to some degree, but the code does not work as well as it could. The matrices that it generates for covariance matrices are very difficult to invert reliably, so that there are significant errors in the final result.
